# OpenFOAM-6-cantera-openmpi and ThirdParty-6-cantera-openmpi

This is a combination of OpenFOAM-6 with cantera with openmpi.

Ensure that OpenFOAM-6-cantera/etc/bashrc has the correct paths for cantera setup - look for the comment "#Source cantera setup"

I don't think any (many?) changes were made to ThirdParty.

I also don't remember if this version works or not.
